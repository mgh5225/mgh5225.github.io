    My research was on Active Inference, initially introduced by Karl Friston.
    My main goal was to design an agent that hallucinates in the virtual environment.
    I used Unity as an environment and implemented the agent with PyTorch.
    For connecting my algorithm to Unity, I used the Unity ML-Agents package.
