  description: >
    My research is on Active Inference, initially introduced by Karl Friston.
    My main goal is to design an agent that hallucinates in the virtual environment.
    I use Unity as an environment and implement the agent with PyTorch.
    For connecting my algorithm to Unity, I use the Unity ML-Agents package.
