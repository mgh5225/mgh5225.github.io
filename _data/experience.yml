    I was a full-stack developer at Dutycope.
    My main goal was to create an API for a freelance website (Dutycope.com):
    <ul>
      <li>I implemented a server with Node.js and config the web server to create an API.</li>
      <li>I created the frontend with React.js and Next.js and connected the frontend to the backend.</li>
      <li>For the file server, I connected the server to google drive for better protection and management.</li>
    </ul>
